# Ribosome
Ribosome is a new AI code generation that will help you achieve success with your software projects, by generating for you the 3 commons layers of a software : Data managing, API exposition, the link between. You give him the specifications and he writes the code for you a functionnal application in a few minutes.

He's working with AspNetCore and EntityFrameworkCore and he's compatible with AspMvc, WebApi and EntityFramework 6.

## Philosophy
Ribosome do only what you tell him what to do, no more, no less :
+ He delivers only the generic code of a software, business code will always remain to be the team project dev.
+ You tell Ribosome how to architect the code, because there is no unique software architecture that have all the answers.
+ He write the code like a human with quality and as little as possible tech debt in mind, so that you can maintain and extend it easily.

You are the architect that give him the specification and he writes the code for you.

## What you get
Layers that Ribosome can generate for you :

1. Create a Data Cluster Manager with an existing or a new DB
	+ Contain a DAL
	+ Expose more than 13 methods for each DB Objects 
	+ Synchronize data cluster by delta
	+ Have an audit-trail
	+ All CRUD methods are driven by a fluent state machine

2. API Cluser Manager with
	+ Ressource oriented with CRUD methods that use HTTP verbs... with the respect of RFC 2616
	+ Managing ressource cluster
	+ Swagger compatible
	+ HATEOAS link 
	+ Versionning, paginate, sorts, filters
	+ Can be used directly with ASP / Angular
	
3. Build the link between DAL and API to get a working software, that is compatible with [SOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture)/[ROA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource-oriented_architecture), micro-service architecture! The application can be used and/or feed a Datalake.

Every layers manage logging events and are async compatible. Also everything is extendable if you want to specify the behavior(s) of the written application.
